# simple-3d-world
I want to create a simple spherical procedural world with javascript and html5.  I'm going to record the process. I have no idea how 3d javascript works. Lets go!

# world elements
* day and night
* spherical hex
* trees, sea, grass and montains

# customization
* day time
* hex quantity
* customizable procedural elements generation
